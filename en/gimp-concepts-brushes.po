The brush pixmaps represent the marks that are made by single <span class=\"quote\">“<span class=\"quote\">touches</span>”</span> of the brush to the image. A brush stroke, usually made by moving the pointer across the image with the mouse button held down, produces a series of marks spaced along the trajectory, in a way specified by the characteristics of the brush and the paint tool being used."
