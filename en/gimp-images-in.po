In reality, however, a <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym> image is a a complicated structure, containing a stack of layers plus several other types of objects: a selection mask, a set of channels, a set of paths, an \"undo\" history, etc. In this section we take a detailed look at the components of a <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym> image, and the things that you can do with them."

When alpha is maximal (255), the layer is opaque (you cannot see through it), and the color is determined by the color of the layer. Intermediate alpha values correspond to varying degrees of transparency / opacity: the color at the location is a proportional mixture of color from the layer and color from underneath."

msgid "The third type, <span class=\"emphasis\"><em>indexed</em></span> images, is a bit more complicated to understand. In an indexed image, only a limited set of discrete colors are used, usually 256 or less. These colors form the <span class=\"quote\">“<span class=\"quote\">colormap</span>”</span> of the image, and each point in the image is assigned a color from the colormap. Indexed images have the advantage that they can be represented inside a computer in a way which consumes relatively little memory, and back in the dark ages (say, ten years ago), they were very commonly used. As time goes on, they are used less and less, but they are still important enough to be worth supporting in <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym>. (Also, there are a few important kinds of image manipulation that are easier to implement with indexed images than with continuous-color RGB images.)"

Many of <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym>'s tools don't work very well on indexed images–and many filters don't work at all–because of the limited number of colors available. Because of this, it is usually best to convert an image to RGB mode before working on it. If necessary, you can convert it back to indexed mode when you are ready to save it"

Usually the fix is to convert the image to a different type, most commonly RGB."
