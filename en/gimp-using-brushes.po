msgid "To add a new brush, after either creating or downloading it, you need to save it in a format GIMP can use. The brush file needs to be placed in the GIMP's brush search path, so that GIMP is able to index and display it in the Brushes dialog. You can hit the <span class=\"guibutton\">Refresh</span> button, which reindexes the brush directory. GIMP uses three file formats for brushes:"

You can convert many other types of images, including many brushes used by other programs, into GIMP brushes by opening them in GIMP and saving them with file names ending in <code class=\"filename\">.gbr</code>. This brings up a dialog box in which you can set the default Spacing for the brush. A more complete description of the GBR file format can be found in the file <code class=\"filename\">gbr.txt</code> in the <code class=\"filename\">devel-docs</code> directory of the GIMP source distribution."

msgid "There are a number of web sites with downloadable collections of GIMP brushes. Rather than supplying a list of links that will soon be out of date, the best advice is to do a search with your favorite search engine for <span class=\"quote\">“<span class=\"quote\">GIMP brushes</span>”</span>. There are also many collections of brushes for other programs with painting functionality. Some can be converted easily into GIMP brushes, some require special conversion utilities, and some cannot be converted at all. Most fancy procedural brush types fall into the last category. If you need to know, look around on the web, and if you don't find anything, look for an expert to ask."
