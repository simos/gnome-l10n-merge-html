Roughly speaking, an <span class=\"quote\">“<span class=\"quote\">image</span>”</span> corresponds to a single file, such as a TIFF or JPEG file. You can also think of an image as corresponding to a single display window, but this is not quite correct: it is possible to have multiple windows all displaying the same image. It is not possible to have a single window display more than one image, though, or for an image to have no window displaying it."

Instead of thinking of it as something like a sheet of paper with a picture on it, think of it as more like a book, whose pages are called <span class=\"quote\">“<span class=\"quote\">layers</span>”</span>. In addition to a stack of layers, a <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym> image may contain a selection mask, a set of channels, and a set of paths.

Sophisticated <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym> users often deal with images containing many layers, even dozens of them. Layers need not be opaque, and they need not cover the entire extent of an image, so when you look at an image's display, you may see more than just the top layer: you may see elements of many layers."

Every Channel in a layer has exactly the same size as the layer to which it belongs, and, consequently consists of the same number of pixels. Every pixel can be regarded as a container which can be filled with a value ranging from 0 to 255.The exact meaning of this value depends on the type of channel, e.g. in the <acronym class=\"acronym\">RGB</acronym> color model the value in the <span class=\"emphasis\"><em>R</em></span>-channel means the amount of red which is added to the color of the different pixels, in the selection channel, the value denotes how strongly the pixels are selected, and in the alpha channel the values denote how transparent the corresponding pixels are."

msgid "Often when modify an image, you only want a part of the image to be affected. The <span class=\"quote\">“<span class=\"quote\">selection</span>”</span> mechanism makes this possible. Each image has its own selection, which you normally see as a moving dashed line separating the selected parts from the unselected parts (the so-called <span class=\"quote\">“<span class=\"quote\">marching ants</span>”</span> ). Actually this is a bit misleading: selection in <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym> is graded, not all-or-nothing, and really the selection is represented by a full-fledged grayscale channel. The dashed line that you normally see is simply a contour line at the 50%-selected level. At any time, though, you can visualize the selection channel in all its glorious detail by toggling the <a class=\"link\" href=\"gimp-image-window-qmask-button.html\" title=\"3.&#xA0;The QuickMask\">QuickMask</a> button."

In fact, you can usually undo a substantial number of the most recent things you did, if you decide that they were misguided. <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym> makes this possible by keeping a history of your actions. This history consumes memory, though, so undoability is not infinite. Some actions use very little undo memory, so that you can do dozens of them before the earliest ones are deleted from this history; other types of actions require massive amounts of undo memory. You can configure the amount of memory <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym> allows for the undo history of each image, but in any situation, you should always be able to undo at least your 2-3 most recent actions. (The most important action that is not undoable is closing an image. For this reason, <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym> asks you to confirm that you really want to close the image if you have made any changes to it.)"

Many important plug-ins are bundled with <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym>, but there are also many available by other means.

It is also possible to write <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym> scripts in Python or Perl. These languages are more flexible and powerful than Script-Fu; their disadvantage is that they depend on software that does not automatically come packaged with <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym>, so they are not guaranteed to work correctly in every <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym> installation."
