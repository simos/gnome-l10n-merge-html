msgid "One of the nicest things about <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym> is how easily its functionality can be extended, by using plugins. <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym> plugins are external programs that run under the control of the main <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym> application and interact with it very closely. Plugins can manipulate images in almost any way that users can. Their advantage is that it is much easier to add a capability to <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym> by writing a small plugin than by modifying the huge mass of complex code that makes up the <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym> core. Many valuable plugins have C source code that only comes to 100-200 lines or so."

Most of them can be accessed through the <span class=\"guimenu\">Filters</span> menu (in fact, everything in that menu is a plugin), but a number are located in other menus. In many cases you can use one without ever realizing that it is a plugin: for example, the \"Normalize\" function for automatic color correction is actually a plugin, although there is nothing about the way it works that would tell you this."

With this freedom from constraint comes a certain degree of risk, though: the fact that anybody can do it means that there is no effective quality control. The plugins distributed with <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym> have all been tested and tuned by the developers, but many that you can download were just hacked together in a few hours and then tossed to the winds. Some plugin creators just don't care about robustness, and even for those who do, their ability to test on a variety of systems in a variety of situations is often quite limited. Basically, when you download a plugin, you are getting something for free, and sometimes you get exactly what you pay for. This is not said in an attempt to discourage you, just to make sure you understand reality."

Strictly speaking, this is quite correct, because plugins have the power to alter almost anything in <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym>, but for practical purposes, experience has shown that corruption is actually quite rare, and many users just continue working and don't worry about it. Our advice is that you simply think about how much trouble it would cause you if something went wrong, and weigh it against the odds."
msgstr ""

#: en/gimp-scripting.html:349(p)
msgid "Because of the way plugins communicate with <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym>, they do not have any mechanism for being informed about changes you make to an image after the plugin has been started. If you start a plugin, and then alter the image using some other tool, the plugin will often crash, and when it doesn't will usually give a bogus result. You should avoid running more than one plugin at a time on an image, and avoid doing anything to the image until the plugin has finished working on it. If you ignore this advice, not only will you probably screw up the image, you will probably screw up the undo system as well, so that you won't even be able to recover from your foolishness."
