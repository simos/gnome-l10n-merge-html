The Tool Options section is actually a separate dialog, shown docked to the Main Toolbox in the screenshot. Knowledgeable users almost always have it set up this way: it is very difficult to use tools effectively without being able to see how their options are set. The Layers dialog comes into play when you work with an image with multiple layers: after you advance beyond the most basic stages of <acronym class=\"acronym\">GIMP</acronym> expertise, this means <span class=\"emphasis\"><em>almost always</em></span>.
