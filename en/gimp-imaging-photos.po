msgid "One of the most common uses of GIMP is to fix digital camera images that for some reason are less than perfect. Maybe the image is overexposed or underexposed; maybe rotated a bit; maybe out of focus: these are all common problems for which GIMP has good tools. The purpose of this chapter is to give you an overview of those tools and the situations in which they are useful. You will not find detailed tutorials here: in most cases it is easier to learn how to use the tools by experimenting with them than by reading about them. (Also, each tool is described more thoroughly in the Help section devoted to it.) You will also not find anything in this chapter about the multitude of \"special effects\" that you can apply to an image using GIMP. You should be familiar with basic GIMP concepts before reading this chapter, but you certainly don't need to be an expert–if you are, you probably know most of this anyway. And don't hesitate to experiment: GIMP's powerful \"undo\" system allows you to recover from almost any mistake with a simple <span class=\"keycap\"><strong>Ctrl</strong></span>+<span class=\"keycap\"><strong>Z</strong></span>."

Activate this by clicking its icon <span class=\"guiicon\"><img src=\"images/toolbox/stock-tool-rotate-22.png\"/></span> in the Toolbox, or by pressing the <span class=\"keycap\"><strong>Shift</strong></span>+<span class=\"keycap\"><strong>R</strong></span> while inside the image.

msgid "Now as a matter of fact, it isn't so easy to get things right by this method: you often find that things are better but not quite perfect. One solution is to rotate a bit more, but there is a disadvantage to that approach. Each time you rotate an image, because the rotated pixels don't line up precisely with the original pixels, the image inevitably gets blurred a little bit. For a single rotation, the amount of blurring is quite small, but two rotations cause twice as much blurring as one, and there is no reason to blur things more than you have to. A better alternative is to undo the rotation and then do another, adjusting the angle."

msgid "The most generally useful technique for sharpening a fuzzy image is called the <a class=\"link\" href=\"plug-in-unsharp-mask.html\" title=\"3.9.&#xA0;Unsharp Mask\">Unsharp Mask</a>. In spite of the rather confusing name, which derives from its origins as a technique used by film developers, its result is to make the image sharper, not <span class=\"quote\">“<span class=\"quote\">unsharp</span>”</span>. It is a plug-in, and you can access it as Filters-&gt;Enhance-&gt;Unsharp Mask in the image menu. There are two parameters, <span class=\"quote\">“<span class=\"quote\">Radius</span>”</span> and <span class=\"quote\">“<span class=\"quote\">Amount</span>”</span>. The default values often work pretty well, so you should try them first. Increasing either the radius or the amount increases the strength of the effect. Don't get carried away, though: if you make the unsharp mask too strong, it will amplify noise in the image and also give rise to visible artifacts where there are sharp edges."

When this happens, you can often get better results by decomposing the image into separate Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) layers, and running Unsharp Mask on the Value layer only, then recomposing. This works because the human eye has much finer resolution for brightness than for color. See the sections on <a class=\"link\" href=\"plug-in-decompose-registered.html\" title=\"8.16.&#xA0; Decompose\">Decompose</a> and <a class=\"link\" href=\"plug-in-compose.html\" title=\"8.15.&#xA0;Compose\">Compose</a> for more information."

You can <span class=\"quote\">“<span class=\"quote\">smooth out</span>”</span> the graininess by blurring the image, but then you will also lose sharpness. There are a couple of approaches that may give better results. Probably the best, if the graininess is not too bad, is to use the filter called <a class=\"link\" href=\"plug-in-sel-gauss.html\" title=\"2.4.&#xA0;Selective Gaussian Blur\">Selective Blur</a>, setting the blurring radius to 1 or 2 pixels. The other approach is to use the <a class=\"link\" href=\"plug-in-despeckle.html\" title=\"3.4.&#xA0;Despeckle\">Despeckle</a> filter. This has a nice preview, so you can play with the settings and try to find some that give good results.

Once you have created a reasonable selection, activate Despeckle, and watch the preview as you adjust the parameters. If you are lucky, you will be able to find a setting that removes the junk while minimally affecting the area around it.
