    This section provides a brief introduction to the basic concepts and
    terminology used in <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>. The concepts presented here
    are explained in
    much greater depth elsewhere. With a few exceptions, we have avoided
    cluttering this section with a lot of links and cross-references:
    everything mentioned here is so high-level that you can easily
    locate it in the index.

          <dl>
            <dt>

              <p>
          Images are the basic entities used by <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>.
          Roughly speaking, an <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">image</span>”</span> corresponds to a
          single file, such as a TIFF or JPEG file. You can also think of an
          image as corresponding to a single display window, but this is not
          quite correct: it is possible to have multiple windows all
          displaying the same image. It is not possible to have a single
          window display more than one image, though, or for an image to have
          no window displaying it.
        </p>
              <p>
          A <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> image may be quite a complicated thing.
          Instead of thinking of it as something like a sheet of paper with a
          picture on it, think of it as more like a book, whose
          pages are called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">layers</span>”</span>. In addition to a stack of
          layers, a <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> image may contain a selection
          mask, a set of channels, and a set of paths. In fact,
          <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> provides a mechanism for attaching arbitrary
          pieces of data, called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">parasites</span>”</span>, to an image.
        </p>
              <p>
          In <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>, it is possible to have many images open
          at the same time. Although large images may use many megabytes of
          memory, <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> uses a sophisticated
          tile-based memory management system that allows
          <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> to handle very large images gracefully.
          There are limits, however, and having more memory available
          may improve system performance.
        </p>

            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
          If an image is like a book, then a layer is like a page within the
          book. The simplest images contain only a single layer, and can be
          treated like single sheets of paper. Sophisticated
          <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> users often deal with images containing
          many layers, even dozens of them.  Layers need not be opaque, and
          they need not cover the entire extent of an image, so when you
          look at an image's display, you may see more than just the top
          layer: you may see elements of many layers.

            <dd>
              <p>
          In <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>, Channels are the smallest units of
          subdivision in the stack of layers from which the image is
          constructed. Every Channel in a layer has exactly the same size as
          the layer to which it belongs, and, consequently consists of the
          same number of pixels. Every pixel can be regarded as a container
          which can be filled with a value ranging from 0 to 255.The exact
          meaning of this value depends on the type of channel, e.g. in the
          <acronym class="acronym">RGB</acronym> color model the value in the
          <span class="emphasis"><em>R</em></span>-channel means the amount of red which is
          added to the color of the different pixels, in the selection
          channel, the value denotes how strongly the pixels are
          selected, and in the alpha channel the values denote how
          transparent the corresponding pixels are.

              <p>
          Often when modify an image, you only want a part of the image
          to be affected. The <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">selection</span>”</span>
          mechanism makes this possible. Each image has its own selection,
          which you normally see as a moving dashed line separating the
          selected parts from the unselected parts (the so-called
          <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">marching ants</span>”</span> ). Actually this is a bit misleading:
          selection in <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
          is graded, not all-or-nothing, and really the selection is
          represented by a full-fledged grayscale channel. The dashed line
          that you normally see is simply a contour line at the 50%-selected
          level. At any time, though, you can visualize the selection channel
          in all its glorious detail by toggling the
          <a class="link" href="gimp-image-window-qmask-button.html" title="3. The QuickMask">QuickMask</a>
          button.
        </p>
              <p>
          A large component of learning how to use <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
          effectively is acquiring the art of making good
          selections—selections that contain exactly what you need and nothing
          more. Because selection-handling is so centrally important,
          <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> provides many tools for doing
          it: an assortment of selection-making tools, a menu of selection
          operations, and the ability to switch to Quick Mask mode, in which
          you can treat the selection channel as though it were a color
          channel, thereby <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">painting the selection</span>”</span>.

            <dd>
              <p>
          When you make mistakes, you can undo them. Nearly everything you can
          do to an image is undoable. In fact, you can usually undo a
          substantial number of the most recent things you did, if you decide
          that they were misguided. <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> makes this
          possible by keeping a history of your actions. This history consumes
          memory, though, so undoability is not infinite. Some actions use
          very little undo memory, so that you can do dozens of them before
          the earliest ones are deleted from this history; other types of
          actions require massive amounts of undo memory. You can configure
          the amount of memory <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> allows for the undo
          history of each image, but in any situation, you should always be
          able to undo at least your 2-3 most recent actions. (The most
          important action that is not undoable is closing an image. For this
          reason, <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> asks you to confirm that you really
          want to close the image if you have made any changes to it.)

          Many, probably most, of the things that you do to an image in
          <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> are done by the <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
          application itself. However, <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> also makes
          extensive use of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">plug-ins</span>”</span>, which are external programs
          that interact very closely with <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>, and are
          capable of manipulating images and other <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
          objects in very sophisticated ways. Many important plug-ins are
          bundled with <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>, but there are also
          many available by other means. In fact, writing
          plug-ins (and scripts) is the easiest way for people not on the
          <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> development team to add new capabilities to
          <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>.
        </p>
              <p>
          All of the commands in the Filters menu, and a substantial number of
          commands in other menus, are actually implemented as plug-ins.

              <p>
          In addition to plug-ins, which are programs written in the C
          language, <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> can also make use of scripts. The
          largest number of
          existing scripts are written in a language called Script-Fu, which
          is unique to <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym> (for those who care, it is a
          dialect of the
          Lisp-like language called Scheme). It is also possible to write
          <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
          scripts in Python or Perl. These languages are more flexible and
          powerful than Script-Fu; their disadvantage is that they depend on
          software that does not automatically come packaged with
          <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>, so
          they are not guaranteed to work correctly in every
          <acronym class="acronym">GIMP</acronym>
          installation.
