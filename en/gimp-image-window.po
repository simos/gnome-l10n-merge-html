The Title Bar in an image window without an image reads <span class=\"quote\">“<span class=\"quote\">GNU Image Manipulating Program</span>”</span>. An image window with an image displays the image name and its specifications in the title bar according to the settings in <a class=\"link\" href=\"gimp-pimping.html#gimp-prefs-dialog\" title=\"1.&#xA0;Preferences Dialog\">Preference Dialog</a>. Each window displays exactly one image, or no image if no image is open. Each image is displayed in one or more image windows; it is unusual to display the same image in more than one window. We will begin with a brief description of the components that are present by default in an ordinary image window. Some of the components can be removed by using commands in the <a class=\"link\" href=\"gimp-view-menu.html\" title=\"5.&#xA0;The &#x201C;View&#x201D; Menu\">View</a> menu."
